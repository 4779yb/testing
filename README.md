o handle situations where Apache NiFi’s flow is halted due to data quality issues (e.g., null values in critical fields like account numbers) while consuming from an upstream Kafka topic, you can use a combination of NiFi processors to manage error handling and data validation. Here’s a general approach to ensure that NiFi continues processing good quality data even when some events have issues:

Use the ValidateRecord Processor:

Add a ValidateRecord processor to your flow. This processor can validate the incoming records against a schema (e.g., Avro schema). You can specify rules to handle fields that must not be null. Configure the ValidateRecord processor to define the schema and validation rules. Handle Validation Failures:

The ValidateRecord processor will route invalid records to the “failure” relationship. By default, if records fail validation, they can be routed to a different processor for handling. Configure the “failure” relationship to route invalid records to a LogAttribute processor or a custom PutFile processor to log them for further inspection. Route Valid Records:

Configure the “success” relationship of the ValidateRecord processor to continue processing the valid records. Connect it to the next processor(s) in your flow for further processing. Use RouteOnAttribute Processor:

If you’re not using record-based validation, you can use the RouteOnAttribute processor to inspect specific attributes and route data accordingly. Create dynamic properties in RouteOnAttribute to check for null values or other data quality issues. Route records that fail the checks to a separate path for error handling. Configure Error Handling:

Add error handling logic for your downstream processors. For example, use a PutFile processor to save invalid records to a file or a PutKafka processor to send them to a different Kafka topic for later analysis. Optionally, use a Retry mechanism or error handling flow to manage records that might be processed again after correcting issues. Monitor and Alert:

Set up monitoring and alerting for your NiFi instance. Use processors like LogAttribute to log events and potential issues. Implement NiFi’s built-in monitoring or integrate with external monitoring tools to keep track of the flow’s health and performance. Example Flow ConsumeKafka (Consumer Processor)

ValidateRecord (Validate the incoming data based on schema)

success → Further Processing (e.g., transformation, enrichment) failure → LogAttribute or PutFile (Log or store invalid records) Further Processing → Next Steps (e.g., store data, forward to another system)

Tips Regularly review and update your schema and validation rules to adapt to any changes in data requirements. Ensure that your NiFi instance has appropriate error handling and monitoring to minimize disruptions in data processing. By implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your NiFi flow continues to process valid data while handling or ignoring records that don't meet your quality criteria.
