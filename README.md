1. Operational KPIs (for Production Support)
Incident Response Time: Measure how quickly the support team acknowledges and begins working on incidents.

Target: 90% of incidents acknowledged within X minutes.
Incident Resolution Time (MTTR): Measure how quickly incidents are resolved.

Target: Average MTTR within X hours for high-priority incidents and X hours for lower-priority ones.
First Call Resolution Rate: Tracks the percentage of incidents resolved on the first contact without needing escalation.

Target: 80%+ first-call resolution rate.
On-Call Effectiveness: Track effectiveness of handling alerts during on-call hours.

Target: % of alerts handled without escalation, keeping minimal interruptions outside working hours.
Alert Reduction: Measure the reduction in the number of alerts over time, aiming to decrease noise through tuning and automation.

Target: X% reduction in alerts over the next six months.
Incident Escalation Rate: Track the percentage of incidents that get escalated to higher levels.

Target: ≤ 10% escalation rate for incidents, ensuring effective first-level support resolution.
2. Automation and Proactive Improvement KPIs
Automation Rate: Measure the percentage of repetitive tasks or workflows automated over time.

Target: Automate X% of repetitive tasks over six months.
Preventative Maintenance (Problem Management): Track initiatives to reduce recurring incidents and issues.

Target: X problem management cases resolved per month.
Time Spent on Preventive Measures: Measure the proportion of time spent on proactive measures versus reactive incident management.

Target: 20-30% of time on proactive maintenance and automation efforts.
Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): Tracks how quickly issues are detected (either manually or automatically).

Target: Detect X% of critical issues within Y minutes.
3. User Support and Satisfaction KPIs
Service Request Fulfillment Time: Measure the average time taken to fulfill service requests from users.

Target: 90% of requests completed within X hours or days, depending on complexity.
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Survey users after incident or request closure.

Target: ≥ 90% positive feedback from user surveys.
4. Development KPIs (for Frontend/Backend Development)
Velocity (Feature Throughput): Track the number of features or stories completed per sprint or month.

Target: X features delivered per sprint, based on expected development cadence.
Quality of Code (Bug Density): Measure the number of defects per 1,000 lines of code in production releases.

Target: Bug density below a set threshold (e.g., less than 1 per 1,000 lines of code).
Deployment Frequency: Track how frequently code changes are deployed to production.

Target: Weekly/bi-weekly deployments based on development cycles.
Lead Time for Changes: Measure the time taken from code commit to deployment in production.

Target: Median lead time below X hours/days.
Time to Resolve Development Bugs: Track the average time taken to resolve bugs that arise during development or post-deployment.

Target: Resolve 90% of development bugs within X days.
5. Collaboration and Continuous Improvement KPIs
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Measure frequency and effectiveness of collaboration between support and development teams, especially for incident resolution.

Target: Monthly joint reviews or retrospectives with action items.
Post-Incident Review Completion Rate: Track completion of post-incident reviews and implementation of corrective actions.

Target: 100% of major incidents reviewed, with improvements tracked and implemented.
Innovation/Enhancement Rate: Track new ideas or improvements suggested and implemented for the platform.

Target: X new improvements per quarter driven by vendor team.
6. Compliance and SLA Adherence
SLA Adherence Rate: Measure adherence to SLAs for various categories like uptime, response, and resolution times.
Target: 99%+ adherence to SLAs.
KPI Monitoring and Reporting
Set up regular reporting mechanisms (weekly/monthly) to review these KPIs with your vendor. Automated monitoring of KPIs through dashboards can provide real-time visibility, ensuring that both teams are aligned with goals and can act swiftly if any metrics fall short.
