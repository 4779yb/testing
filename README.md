Given this transition, we need to retain the existing data from the legacy system for the entirety of 2024. This will ensure that we can adequately address any potential audit findings and production issues where historical data may be required. Additionally, maintaining access to this data will serve as a contingency plan during this critical period.

We are confident that the extension will allow us to manage the transition more smoothly and ensure that all necessary data remains accessible and compliant with audit requirements.
